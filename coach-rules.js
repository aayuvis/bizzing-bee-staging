/* Bizzing Bee — the Coach's rulebook. Hardcoded, offline, no model anywhere.

   The app already knows WHERE a speller goes wrong: TRAP_DEFS clusters their misses into
   eight named patterns (app3.js, missTraps), and trickAnal names the concept family of any
   single word. What it never had was anything to SAY about it — the trap page could tell a
   child "Silent letters · 6 misses" and then offer nothing but more of the same words.

   This is the missing half: for every trap, the mistake in the child's own terms, the rule
   that fixes it, a check they can run in their head at the microphone, and worked examples.
   Written once, by hand. The same discipline as SB_TIPS, which is parent-facing and picked
   "by analytics rules, never AI" — this is the child-facing twin.

   Keys MUST match TRAP_DEFS + the origin keys missTraps adds (french/greek/latin), and
   `cls` maps the trickAnal families onto the same rows. There is a headless check for that
   in tests/coach-rules.js: a trap with no rule is a silent hole in the page.  */
