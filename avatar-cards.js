   AVATAR-CARDS.js — collectible trump-card layer for all 160 avatars.
   Every avatar in SB_AVATARS gets, derived deterministically from its id +
   rarity (stable across sessions, no per-avatar hand-authoring needed):
     • four core stats (Spark / Wisdom / Speed / Grit, 0-99) + an overall
     • a pack-voiced greeting for the home page speech bubble
     • a title (WWE/Pokémon style)
     • one REAL, kid-friendly word fact (educational)
   The 10 villains keep their hand-written lore from SB_AVATAR_LORE.
