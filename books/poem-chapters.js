/* THE COMPANION OF LINES WORTH KEEPING — poems, sonnets, haiku and the long
   quotes, for a speller.

   Every text here is in the public domain, and every one is printed WHOLE where
   it is short enough to print whole; where it is not, the passage is the one
   people actually quote, cut at a line that closes. Nothing is paraphrased.

   The book is not a general anthology. It belongs in a spelling library because
   of the last field on every piece: `hard`, the words in that text a speller
   should be able to spell and say. A child who has learned the Tempest speech
   has met `insubstantial` and `pageant` in the only place they are unforgettable.
