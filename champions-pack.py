"""champions-pack.py — avatar art for the Spelling Champions pack.

    python3 champions-pack.py --all

Five children who won a national spelling bee between 1908 and 1928, drawn in the same
chibi register as the rest of the collection and dropped into `avatars/` as 384px RGBA
webp, which is what avatars.js expects.

ON DRAWING REAL PEOPLE. The film these come from refuses to generate a picture of any of
these children, because there it would sit beside genuine Library of Congress photographs
and a viewer could not tell which was the document. An avatar is the opposite case: the
pack already carries Marie Curie, Gandhi, Florence Nightingale and Martin Luther King Jr.
in exactly this style, nobody mistakes a chibi sticker for a photograph, and the convention
is established. These are characters inspired by real champions, not claimed likenesses,
and none of them is drawn from a specific photograph.
