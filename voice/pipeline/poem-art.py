"""One bespoke plate per PIECE for the poems companion (book-lines).

WHY
  The book first shipped with sixteen plates, one per subject (`th`). With
  ninety pieces that meant the same painting turned up five or six times, which
  is the one thing an anthology cannot do.

KEYING
  The slug is derived from the piece's TITLE and must match pieceSlug() in
  books/mkbooks.js exactly:
      'pp-' + title.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g,'-')
                   .replace(/^-+|-+$/g,'').slice(0,44)
  Deliberately NOT the piece's index: adding one poem shifts every index after
  it, and index-keyed art silently re-attaches itself to the wrong poem.

SCENES
  books/art/poem-scenes.json maps slug -> a one-line scene description. Any
  piece without an entry falls back to a scene built from its subject, and any
  piece with no plate at all falls back in mkbooks to the themed plate — so
  this can be run in batches and the book is never broken in between.

USAGE
  python3 voice/pipeline/poem-art.py            # generate everything missing
  python3 voice/pipeline/poem-art.py --list     # show what is missing, generate nothing
  python3 voice/pipeline/poem-art.py --limit 20 # generate at most 20 this run
  NB_MODEL=gemini-3-pro-image python3 ...       # quota is per-model, so switch on 429
Resumable: a slug whose .jpg already exists is skipped.

STYLE = ('Hand-inked illustration with soft watercolour washes, a light and airy register, '
         'three or four muted inks, generous negative space, darks only where the drawing needs '
         'weight. Delicate, literary, the feel of a fine printed anthology — not a poster and not '
         'a cartoon. The image must stay CALM and LOW-CONTRAST through its middle so that text '
         'can sit over it. ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT, NO LETTERING, NO WRITING, NO LABELS, NO NUMBERS, '
         'NO SIGNAGE — every page, book, banner and sign in the picture is COMPLETELY BLANK. '
         'No people, no faces, no characters — imply presence instead (an empty chair, a moored '
         'boat, footprints, a lit window). ')

# THE EPICS GET THEIR OWN REGISTER.
# The house style above is deliberately quiet — hand-inked, low-contrast, no
# figures — because it has to sit under a fourteen-line lyric without competing.
# That is exactly wrong for Homer and the Mahabharata. An epic page wants scale:
# distance, weather, monumental architecture, a sky doing something. And two of
# these pieces are ABOUT a person speaking, so the no-figures rule is lifted for
# the slugs in EPIC_FIGURES — a sermon delivered from a chariot is not a still
# life. The middle of the frame still has to stay readable, so the drama is
# pushed to the sky and the edges.

              'lower in contrast so text can sit over it, and push the drama to the sky and the '
