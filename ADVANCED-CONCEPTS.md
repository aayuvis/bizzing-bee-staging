# Advanced Coaching — Concept Gap Analysis

What the concept engine already teaches, what serious competitors actually study,
and what our word data can support. Written as a build spec: every candidate
carries its library inventory, so nothing here is aspirational.

## Build status — all 43 chapters shipped

Every Tier A, B, C and D candidate below is now built and live in the Advanced Pack
(`adv-concepts-data.js`, `SB_ADV_CONCEPTS` version 2):

| Tier | Chapters | Category shown in-app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 4 | Championship Procedure |
| B | 19 | Advanced Orthography |
| C | 11 | Origins Beyond the Big Four |
| D | 9 | How Words Are Built |
| **Total** | **43** | 258 narrated scenes, 1,022 drill words |

Each chapter carries four teaching cards, a worked microphone example, six narrated
scenes (`am_michael`, `voice/a<chapter>-<scene>.mp3`) and its own drill list. Drill
words are looked up from `words-data.js` / `words-full.js` by the build script, so a
chapter can never promise a word the speller cannot practise — 642 of the 1,022 come
from the core competition list.

**D9 (diacritics) was deliberately not built as a chapter.** The core library carries
zero diacritic-bearing headwords, so it is a data-sourcing job first. That remains open.

Two findings worth recording from the build:

- **The `o` origin field is unreliable for blends and coinages.** It tags `spooktacular`
  and `rockumentary` as Dutch and `champagneless` as Portuguese. The Tier C word lists
  are therefore hand-curated from etymology and verified present in the library, not
  filtered on `o`. Do not mine origin chapters from that field.
- **The `r` etymology field contains mislabelled generated text** — e.g. `hyperbolicity`
  carries `"Dutch: -icus (Dutch)"`. Never match origins against `r`.

## Where the existing curriculum stands

`concepts-data.js` — **121 chapters**, difficulty split **easy 20 / medium 87 / hard 14**.

Coverage is deep on morphology and thin on everything else:

| Area | Chapters | State |
|---|---|---|
| Latin prefixes / roots / suffixes | 30 | Thorough |
| Greek prefixes / roots / suffixes | 21 | Thorough |
| Subject-area vocabulary | 17 | Broad |
| Spelling Bee Basics | 11 | Complete for beginners |
| Loanword groups | 12 | **8 languages only** |
| Spelling rules & patterns | 9 | **Scattered, not systematic** |
| Word formation | 3 | **Contronyms, eponyms, homophones — that's all** |
| Advanced Spelling Strategy | 2 | **The 44 phonemes; the schwa problem** |
| Championship Level | 2 | **Rare loanwords; final-10 vocabulary** |

The structural problem: the curriculum teaches **word parts** exhaustively and
**decision procedures** barely at all. A speller who has done all 121 chapters
knows what `-esce` means but has no drilled method for turning a word they have
never heard into a spelling. That method is what separates a strong regional
speller from a national competitor.

## Tier A — the four decision procedures (highest value, largest gap)

These are techniques, not vocabulary. Each deserves a multi-chapter arc.

### A1. Schwa Rescue by Morphological Relative
The schwa is the single largest source of misspellings, because any vowel *and*
`y` can reduce to it, so the sound carries no spelling information at all. The
championship technique is not "listen harder" — it is to find a **related word
where that syllable takes the stress**, which restores the vowel's true identity.

- *definite* is unclear → **de·FIN·ition** shows the `i`
- *custody* is unclear → **cus·TO·dian** shows the `o`
- *major* is unclear → **ma·JOR·ity** shows the `o`
- *local* is unclear → **lo·CAL·ity** shows the `a`

Our existing "The Schwa Problem & Unstressed Vowels" chapter states the problem.
It does not teach the procedure. **Inventory:** 40,435 core words carry an
etymology field and 40,349 carry a memory hint, so the raw material exists; the
work is curating the relative-pairs list.

### A2. Stress Shift Under Derivation
Where the stress lands moves as suffixes attach, and whichever vowel loses the
stress becomes a schwa. Knowing the shift predicts *which* vowel will go
unreliable before you have to spell it.

- **PHO**·to·graph → pho·**TOG**·ra·phy → pho·to·**GRAPH**·ic
- **MON**·arch → **MON**·ar·chy → mo·**NAR**·chic

Suffix classes behave predictably: `-ity`, `-ic`, `-ian`, `-ify` pull stress
toward themselves; `-ness`, `-less`, `-ment` leave it alone. **Inventory:** 23
families already have two or more derivatives sitting in the core library
(*photograph/photography/photographic*, *patriarch/patriarchy/patriarchal*,
*lithograph/lithography/lithographic*); a proper morphological pass would find
many more.

### A3. The Language-of-Origin Decision Tree
We teach eight loanword groups as separate chapters and never unify them. A
competitor needs the **inverse** lookup: *I heard /f/ — in what order do I try
`f`, `ph`, `gh`?* That ordering depends entirely on the origin, which is why
"what is the language of origin?" is the most valuable question at the mic.

The chapter is a decision tree, not a list: heard sound → candidate spellings
ranked by origin probability → which origin each candidate implies → what to ask
next to disambiguate. Worked examples: /k/ before front vowels (`k` Greek, `qu`
Latin, `ch` Greek), /sh/ (`sh` English, `ch` French, `sch` German, `sci` Italian,
`ti/ci` Latin), /ee/ at word end (`i` Italian, `y` English, `ie` Dutch, `is`
Greek).

### A4. Championship Question Strategy
Scripps allows origin, definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, and
use in a sentence. Each answer **eliminates a different set of spellings**, and
there is a correct order to ask in that depends on what the word sounded like.
Our "Ask the Right Questions" chapter exists but is rated *easy* and aimed at
beginners. The advanced version covers: which question to ask first given the
ambiguity you actually face, how alternate pronunciations betray vowel identity,
how a definition disambiguates homophones, and how part of speech settles
`-ance`/`-ant` and `-ent`/`-ence`.

## Tier B — orthographic patterns with real inventory

Ranked by library depth. Counts are **core (40,943) / full (128,196)**.

| # | Concept | Core | Full | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `-ise / -ize / -yse` and the British-American split | 612 | 1,281 | Largest single pattern gap |
| B2 | Latin & Greek plurals: `-ae -i -a -ices -mata` | 254 | 468 | *vertebrae, vortices, auspices, maxillae* |
| B3 | Greek initial silent clusters `ps- pn- mn- chth- phth- rh- bd-` | 170 | 427 | *pneumonia, rhetoric, bdelloid, phthisis* |
| B4 | `-ceous / -cious / -tious / -scious / -xious` | 140 | 235 | *saponaceous, adscititious, specious* |
| B5 | `-oid / -oidal` (resembling) | 112 | 389 | *solenoid, toroidal, rhabdoid* |
| B6 | `-esce / -escent / -escence` (becoming) | 67 | 114 | *erubescent, obsolescent, liquescent* |
| B7 | `-efy` vs `-ify` — only four take `-efy` | 67 | 234 | *liquefy, rarefy, putrefy, stupefy* |
| B8 | `-iferous / -ivorous / -parous / -fugal / -fluous` | 56 | 112 | *fossiliferous, oviparous, vociferous* |
| B9 | `-ance` vs `-ence` after soft c and g | 48 | 83 | *obliviscence, insurgence, beneficence* |
| B10 | `-archy / -cracy / -arch` (rule) | 45 | 119 | *ochlocracy, hierarchy, theocracy* |
| B11 | `-itude / -itudinous` | 32 | 56 | *pulchritude, vicissitude, verisimilitude* |
| B12 | `-mancy / -mantic` (divination) | 28 | 44 | *enoptromancy, chiromancy, ailuromancy* |
| B13 | Word-final `-gm / -gn` | 24 | 65 | *paradigm, phlegm, condign, oppugn* |
| B14 | `-cide / -cidal` (killing) | 26 | 56 | *molluscicide, parasiticide* |
| B15 | `-phagous / -phagy` (eating) | 12 | 29 | *arachnophagous, myrmecophagy* |
| B16 | `-latry / -latrous` (worship) | 11 | 21 | *ichthyolatry, bardolatry* |
| B17 | `-monger / -wright / -smith` (Old English agents) | 11 | 32 | *wheelwright, scandalmonger* |
| B18 | `-gogue / -gogy` (leading) | 8 | 12 | *demagogue, anagogic, pedagogy* |
| B19 | `-cede / -ceed / -sede` | 7 | 18 | Small but a classic trap: three `-ceed`, one `-sede` |

## Tier C — language groups the loanword set is missing

We teach French, Italian, German, Arabic, Japanese, Norse, Sanskrit/Hindi and
Spanish. Everything below is absent, ranked by inventory.

| # | Language group | Core | Full | Diagnostic markers to teach |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Dutch** | 77 | **1,550** | Biggest miss by far. Seafaring and trade vocabulary; `-oo-`, `sch-`, `-kje`. *caboose, cruiser, landscape, measles* |
| C2 | **Yiddish & Hebrew** | 54 | 808 | `sch-`, `kn-`, `-tz`, guttural `ch`. *nosh, kosher, hallelujah* |
| C3 | **Russian & Slavic** | 23 | 421 | `-shka`, `-nik`, `-ov`, `-sky`, initial `zd-/vz-`. *balalaika, babushka, troika* |
| C4 | **Portuguese** | 22 | 271 | `-ão` → `-oon`, `-inho`, nasal vowels. *albatross, flamingo, jacaranda* |
| C5 | **Celtic** (Irish, Welsh, Gaelic, Scots) | 13 | 292 | `-ough`, `ll-`, `-dh-`, `-agh`. *leprechaun, sporran, bodhran, colcannon* |
| C6 | **Turkish & Persian** | 12 | 274 | `-lik`, `-ci`, `khan-`, `-stan`. *jackal, caravan, mogul* |
| C7 | **Malay / Indonesian / Tagalog** | 12 | 259 | Doubled vowels, `-ng`, prefixes `ber-/meng-`. *rattan, ikat, binturong* |
| C8 | **Chinese & Korean** | 8 | 175 | Pinyin vs Wade-Giles (`q/ch`, `x/hs`, `zh/ch`); Korean `-bap`, `-kimchi`. *cheongsam, bibimbap, souchong* |
| C9 | **Hawaiian & Polynesian** | 8 | 82 | Every syllable open, only 13 letters, doubled vowels, glottal stop. *pahoehoe, wahine, kakapo* |
| C10 | **African languages** (Afrikaans, Bantu, Swahili) | 7 | 92 | Afrikaans `-kop`, `-veld`, `aard-`; Bantu prefix classes. *aardwolf, apartheid, commando* |
| C11 | **Native American** (Nahuatl, Algonquian, Quechua) | 3 | 40 | `-tl`, `-quia`; Nahuatl `-tl` is the tell. *atlatl, ullamaliztli* — thin, needs word sourcing first |

## Tier D — word formation and structure

Extends the three existing chapters (contronyms, eponyms, homophones).

| # | Concept | Core | Full | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Assimilation across all prefixes | — | — | We teach it only for `ad-`. Same machinery governs `in-` → `im-/il-/ir-`, `sub-` → `suc-/suf-/sug-`, `ob-` → `oc-/of-/op-`, `com-` → `col-/cor-`. Explains most double consonants in Latinate words |
| D2 | Combining-form stacking | 9,706 | 14,510 | Multi-part Latin/Greek builds. Words of 4+ syllables are 24% of the core library and almost all are stackable — the skill is segmenting an unheard word into known parts |
| D3 | Hyphenated & open compounds | 111 | 752 | *loup-garou, hsaing-waing, hunky-dory*. Scripps rules on hyphens are their own trap |
| D4 | Doublets | — | — | One root, two routes, two spellings: *guard/ward*, *chief/chef*, *frail/fragile*, *cattle/chattel*. Teaches why the same root looks different depending on whether it came via Norman French or Latin |
| D5 | Heteronyms & homographs | — | — | Same spelling, different sound and sense: *desert/desert*, *minute/minute*, *invalid/invalid*. Distinct from the existing homophones chapter, and the reason "use it in a sentence" matters |
| D6 | Metathesis | — | — | Sounds that swapped historically: *through/thorough*, *wasp/waps*, *nostril*. Explains spellings that look scrambled |
| D7 | Back-formation, clipping, blending, reduplication | — | — | How *edit* came from *editor*, *pea* from *pease*; portmanteaus; *hocus-pocus* patterns |
| D8 | Folk etymology & eggcorns | — | — | Words respelled by wrong guesses that then stuck: *bridegroom*, *cole slaw*, *shamefaced*. Explains a whole class of "wrong-looking" correct spellings |
| D9 | Diacritics in loanwords | **0** | 28 | *façade, jalapeño, naïve, résumé*. Notable data gap — the core library carries no diacritic-bearing words at all. Scripps accepts spellings without diacritics, which is itself worth teaching |
| D10 | Tautonyms & reduplicatives | 3 | 60 | *beriberi, laulau, atlatl*. Thin; needs word sourcing |

## Recommended build order

1. **Tier A** (4 chapter arcs) — the biggest capability gain per chapter, and the
   thing no competitor resource in the app currently provides.
2. **B1–B10** (10 chapters) — deep inventory, immediately drillable against
   existing words, no new word sourcing needed.
3. **C1–C4** (4 chapters) — Dutch alone has 1,550 words in the full library and
   is the single largest untaught origin.
4. **D1, D2, D4, D5** (4 chapters) — high conceptual value, and D1 retro-fits
   explanatory power onto the 30 Latin-prefix chapters already shipped.
5. Remaining B and C chapters as fill.
6. **D9 needs data work first**, not a chapter: sourcing diacritic-bearing
   headwords into the library.

Total: roughly **44 new chapters**, which would take the curriculum from 121 to
165 and lift the *hard* count from 14 to around 50.

**Built:** 43 of them (everything except D9, which needs word data first). The general
course stays at 121 chapters; these 43 live in a separate Advanced Pack list so they
cannot leak into the free curriculum.
