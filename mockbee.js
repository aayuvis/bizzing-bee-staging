/* ============================================================
   MOCK SPELLING BEE — the Arcade's competition game.

   Spelling Quest was fifteen seasons of story with a boss at the end of each.
   It was a story mode wearing a spelling bee's clothes. This is the thing the
   child is actually training for: eleven spellers on a stage, one word each,
   miss and you sit down.

   Ten rivals, each a real competitor rather than a difficulty number — an age,
   a skill, a temperament and a speciality. Pip is eight and fast and reckless.
   Theo asks for every legal question and takes forever. Vesper is fifteen, has
   won this before, and does not get nervous. They spell in draw order, they
   misspell in plausible ways, and they go out when they miss.

   And an announcer who calls it like a final: introduces the round, names the
   speller, holds the pause, rings the bell, and gets louder as the field thins.

   Uses app3 globals: state, render, active, save, addCoins, sfx, burstConfetti,
   flash, say, deviceSpeak, corpusSlice, esc, escA, iconSVG, SB_AVATAR, logBand,
   markMastered, nkey, fmtN. Registers actions on `app` (a top-level const in
   app3's scope, NOT window.app) and renders via the nav hook.

  /* ---------------- the rounds, in the Scripps shape ----------------
     A national bee is not a single ladder of spelling rounds. It runs in
     SEGMENTS, and every segment is the same three things: you spell, then you
     answer for meaning, then — when the field is small enough to need deciding
     rather than thinning — you go to the spell-off. Scripps stages that as
     Preliminaries, Quarterfinals, Semifinals and Finals, and this does the same,
     except the stage advances when the field thins rather than when a calendar
     day ends, because this is one sitting with eleven spellers.

     `pct` is the slice of the ranked bee list a round draws from — a percentile
     window rather than a library y-band, because the library's y only reaches 7
     with any depth and a band of [8,9] has almost nothing in it. Windows overlap
     the way a real list does. `press` is the pressure multiplier: what turns a
     nervous speller's fifth round into a coin toss.

     repeats himself anyway, and a child hears these many times.

     buried mid-clause. That is what lets the name be spoken separately — by the
     device's own voice, live — while the rest of the line stays fixed. It is the

     what the Vocabulary section asks. Reusing it means the child meets exactly
     the question they have been practising, and there is one implementation
     rather than two drifting apart.

     The one thing it cannot do unchanged is the late rounds. Its distractors
     come from gameWordsD(), which is scoped to THIS CHILD's difficulty band —
     about 180 words for a level-four speller. Put a championship word against
     three level-four definitions and the right answer is obvious from its
     register alone, without knowing anything. So the bee widens the pool itself
     rather than touching the shared function, whose behaviour the Vocabulary
     section's headless test pins down.

     SB_VOCAB26 is the natural source: 997 words, every one carrying a
     definition, and it is the actual national vocabulary list. */

     cancels whatever is mid-sentence, so every beat scheduled sooner than the
     line takes to read chopped it — a stream of half-sentences, which is what a
     glitch sounds like.

     So: the hall speaks at the app's rate, a shade slower because an announcer
     should be unhurried, and NOTHING is scheduled inside a line that is still
     being read. `after()` is the only timer this file uses from here on. */

     Reading every line in full is correct and unplayable: a bee where the hall
     reads a sentence about each of ten rivals before each of them spells takes
     five minutes to reach round four. So the voice is spent where it earns its
     keep — the open, the draw, every round, YOUR call and YOUR verdict, the
     field thinning, championship rules, the finish — and the routine rival
     chatter is shown on the card and given a two-word call instead, the way a
     real pronouncer says "Correct." and moves on. */
  /* THE ANNOUNCER IS VISUAL. THE ONLY AUDIO IN THIS HALL IS THE WORD.
     He used to be read aloud by the device voice, which fought the word
     pronunciation for the same channel: deviceSpeak cancels whatever is already
     speaking, so a called word could be cut off by the next piece of commentary,
     and on a phone the two voices were indistinguishable anyway. The commentary
     is on screen where it can be read at leisure; say() keeps the word.

     The `spoken` argument is now only a length hint. Do not delete it: the
     announcer's speech duration WAS the bee's pacing — after() waits for
     spokeAt + spokeMs before advancing — so removing the speech without keeping
     a duration collapses every pause and the bee runs as a blur. It is now the
     time the line takes to READ, which is close enough to the time it took to
     hear that the rhythm is unchanged. */
  /* THE ONE PIECE OF THE ANNOUNCER THAT IS SPOKEN: the speller's name.
     A pronouncer calling a name aloud is most of what makes a hall feel like a
     hall, and it is also the one part that could never be pre-recorded — a clip
     per speller per line, which is where the 827-clip estimate came from. So it
     is said live by the device's own voice while everything else stays on screen.

     Deliberately NOT deviceSpeak(): that looks for a word clip first, and several
     of these names are real words in the 41k library (Vesper, Nova, Comet), so a
     name would sometimes come out in the pronouncer's recorded voice and
     sometimes in the device's. One voice for names, always, and it is audibly a
     different one from the word — which is correct, because a name and a word are
     different things being said.

     Rate 0.95 matches the word library, which was synthesised at 0.95 — so the
     name and the word land at the same pace and the hall sounds like one person
     talking, even though one is a recording and one is live. */

  /* ================= ONE VOICE AT A TIME =================
     The hall has three sound sources and they were all firing independently: the
     announcer's recorded clips (<audio>), the speller's name (speechSynthesis)
     and the word (<audio> again). Nothing serialised them, and the two KINDS do
     not block each other — so announce() started a clip and speakName() started
     the name over the top of it in the same tick, and deviceSpeak's own
     speechSynthesis.cancel() then chopped the name off part way through.

     Delays cannot fix that. Two channels playing at once is not a timing problem,
     it is a missing queue. Everything the bee says now goes through ONE queue, in
     order, each item waiting for the previous to actually finish — onended for a
     clip, onend for an utterance — with a duration-derived safety timer under
     both, because neither event fires reliably on every mobile browser and a hall
     that goes permanently silent is worse than one that overlaps by a hair.

     `token` invalidates everything in flight when the bee is left or restarted,
     so an abandoned game cannot talk over the next one. */
